### üåà Namaste!!

Hey, I'm Arjun Aditya, also known as Nermal or NermalCat69 on the internet. I'm a 17-year-old programmer, started coding at a young age. I love cats (though I don't hate dogs) and enjoy building and doing pull-ups.

### ü•™ Programming & Tools

Primarly I work with Typescript, Golang, Php, Ruby, Bash, C and Elixir but still exploring Rust at the moment. Other than that i work with a lot of frameworks and libraries for different usecases at the moment.

For Deployments I stick with [Zerops](https://zerops.io), [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) and [SST](https://sst.dev/).

For design i use figma and for conversion i use cloud convert and for reducing the size of an image i use [simple image resizer](https://simpleimageresizer.com) and converting the web compatible image format webp.

### üéâ Fun Facts

- A random discord friend started religion called nermalism (too complicated to explain).
- My Journey in programming technically started at age 10 with c sharp in unity (I thought we were supposed to make our own games and play them :/ so i used to look for tutorials on how to make a game like minecraft considering i had no idea i could've played it for free using some client ~ other than that i didnt have the time to build my own minecraft lol)

### üíø Stuff I've done so far

I've done a bunch of cool stuff. I've edited videos using Final Cut Pro X and created WordPress themes (for personal use), as well as Ghost.org themes (also for personal use). Sold websites on Flippa. Additionally, I used to write blogs on a website hosted on Ghost.org, which helped me gain a lot of insights about seo. Developed smart contracts on Solana and Ethereum, and built Discord bots using Typescript, among other cool projects.
