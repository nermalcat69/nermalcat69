### 🎉 Fun Facts

- A random discord friend started religion called nermalism (too complicated to explain).
- My Journey in programming technically started at age 10 with c sharp in unity (I thought we were supposed to make our own games and play them :/ so i used to look for tutorials on how to make a game like minecraft considering i had no idea i could've played it for free using some client ~ other than that i didnt have the time to build my own minecraft lol)


### 💿 Stuff I've done so far

- Editing Videos using Fcpx, Wordpress, Ghost.org Themes
- Sold websites on Flippa
- Wrote Blogs using Ghost.org Cms (Spent too much time on seo and everything works on search engines in depth)
