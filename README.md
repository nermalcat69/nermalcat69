<!-- 
OH MY YOU FOUND THIS


Hey, I'm Arjun Aditya, also known as Nermal or NermalCat69 on the internet. I'm a 17-year-old programmer, started coding at a young age. I love cats (though I don't hate dogs) and enjoy building and doing pull-ups. 

My journey in programming technically started at age 10 with C# in Unity. (I thought we were supposed to make our own games and play them :/ so I used to look for tutorials on how to make a game like Minecraft, considering I had no idea I could've played it for free using some client.) Other than that, I didn't have the time to build my own Minecraft, lol. -->

<!-- ### 🥪 Programming & Tools

Primarily, I work with TypeScript, Golang, PHP, Ruby, Bash, C, and Elixir, I am also exploring Rust at the moment. Additionally, I work with many frameworks and libraries for different use cases. 

For Deployments I stick with [Zerops](https://zerops.io), [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) and [SST](https://sst.dev/).

For design, I use Figma, [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com) to convert png/jpg to webp to reduce the size of an image(Don't ask me why i dont use ffmpeg), [Simple Image Resizer](https://simpleimageresizer.com) for resizing the image size(why tf are people using jpg and png everywhere on their site 😭).

I used to use [Skiff](https://skiff.com) for managing my work life, but now it's gone.

### 💿 Stuff I've done so far

I've done a bunch of cool stuff. I've edited videos using Final Cut Pro X and created WordPress themes (for personal use), as well as Ghost.org themes (also for personal use). Sold websites on Flippa. Additionally, I used to write blogs on a website hosted on Ghost.org, which helped me gain a lot of insights about seo. Developed smart contracts on Solana and Ethereum, and built Discord bots using Typescript, among other cool projects. -->
